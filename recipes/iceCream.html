    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Homemade ice cream comes in two basic styles: Custard-style (also called French) and Philadelphia-style (also called New York or American).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream.</li>
        <li>3 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and half of the sugar. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, stir together the cream, half-and-half, salt, and remaining sugar. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring often, until it comes to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture to the egg mixture while whisking constantly (this helps prevent the eggs from cooking). Repeat with another 1/2 cup of the cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Using a heatproof spatula, stir the cream mixture in the saucepan constantly as you pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and mixture coats the back of the spatula, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>
